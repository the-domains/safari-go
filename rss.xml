            <description><![CDATA[<p> The children were from many different cultural backgrounds, including Rwanda, Fiji, Bosnia, Lebanon and Iraqi, and varied in age from toddler to 12. Simeon and his team were able to engage with the children on an individual level and encourage them to participate as a team. Which was no easy task when the kids ranged from extroverted stars of tomorrow to the more shy and reclusive.” Dijana Mackic Coordinator - BHHP Migrant Resource Centre</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Party Safari hosted the Amazing Race at UTS Jumbunna in 2014 for a group of regional Indigenous students who came on campus for a University experience. Needless to say the students, their teachers and our staff had an extraordinary experience that will certainly last a life time. The activity was an excellent and fun way fro students to get to know the campus and UTS.The service was excellent from start to finish. Simeon and his team paid a lot of attention to detail which is very important. They tasks were very safe and fun at the same time. I would highly recommend Party Safari for large scale and complex events. Brigette Sancho Advancement Manager - University of Technology Sydney</p>]]></description>
