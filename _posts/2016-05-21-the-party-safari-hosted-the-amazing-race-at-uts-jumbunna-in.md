description: 'The Party Safari hosted the Amazing Race at UTS Jumbunna in 2014 for a group of regional Indigenous students who came on campus for a University experience. Needless to say the students, their teachers and our staff had an extraordinary experience that will certainly last a life time. The activity was an excellent and fun way fro students to get to know the campus and UTS.The service was excellent from start to finish. Simeon and his team paid a lot of attention to detail which is very important. They tasks were very safe and fun at the same time. I would highly recommend Party Safari for large scale and complex events. Brigette Sancho Advancement Manager - University of Technology Sydney'
